A set of scripts using Rome and Groovy to do RSS or ATOM aggregation.  This might expand to mashing in other data sources, later.  The style is sort of like planetplanet, but more like what I thought planetplanet was supposed to be rather than what it turned out to be.  It supports multiple aggregations in a single site, splitting a single aggregation over multiple pages, easy themability (using CSS).
